   * Download [[https://www.apache.org/dist/atlas/KEYS][Apache Atlas KEYS file]]
   * Verify the signatures using one of the following:

<verbatim>
% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify downloaded_file.asc downloaded_file</verbatim>

or

<verbatim>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv downloaded_file.asc</verbatim>

or

<verbatim>
% pgp -ka KEYS
