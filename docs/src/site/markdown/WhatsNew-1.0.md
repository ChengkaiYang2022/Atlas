* Performance improvements in Atlas Hooks, by switching to use V2 style notifications
* Significant updates in Atlas Web UI

## Changes

### DSL search

With DSL rewrite and simplification, some older constructs may not work. Here's a list of behavior changes from previous
releases. More DSL related changes can be found [here](Search-Advanced.html).

   * When filtering or narrowing results using string attribute, the value **MUST** be enclosed in double quotes
      * Table name="Table1"
      * Table where name="Table1"
   * Join queries are no longer supported e.g. hive_table, hive_db 
   * Select clauses only work with immediate entity attributes or a single referred (entity) type.
      * Table select name, owner
      * Table select Columns 
      * Table select name, owner, Columns _*(won't work)*_
   * OrderBy clause can only be used with a _*single primitive*_ attribute.
   * GroupBy clause can only be used with a _*single primitive*_ attribute.
      * Table groupby name
      * Table groupby Columns (won't work)
   * Typename can't have multiple aliases
      * Table as t (OK)
      * Table as t1, t2 (won't work)
  * Has clause only works with primitive attributes.
     * Table has name
      * Table has Columns or Table has DB (NOT supported)
  * Aggregator clause can only be used with a _*single primitive*_ attribute.
      * Table select min(name)
      * Table select max(name)
      * Table select sum(createTime)
      * Table select min(Columns) (won't work)
      * Table select max(Columns) (won't work)
      * Table select sum(Columns) (won't work)
  * Aggregator clause can't be repeated with different _*primitive attribute*_, the clause appearing last would take preference.
      * Table select min(name), min(createTime) will ignore _*min(name)*_
  * Limit and offset are not applicable when using aggregator clauses (min, max, sum)
      *  Table select min(name) limit 10 offset 5 - min(name) is computed over **ALL** entities of type Asset
